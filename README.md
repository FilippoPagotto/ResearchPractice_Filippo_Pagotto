# Research Practice: Filippo Pagotto

# Plan for upcomming weeks:
* Week 1-4: Code development
* Week 5-8: Code optimization
* Week 9-12: Comparation with other similar solutions

# Week 1:
*05.03.2024*
In this week's code, I employed machine learning techniques to predict traffic counts. Using the Python programming language, I loaded the dataset from a CSV file. As the CSV file is large, I plan to upload it to the repository at a later stage.

The preprocessing steps involved handling missing values by filling them with column means and label encoding categorical columns. Two distinct feature selection methods, correlation matrix and ANOVA, were utilized, and neural network models were trained separately using features selected from each method.

Predictions were made on the test set for both correlation-based and ANOVA-based features, and evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2) were calculated for each model. The results, along with the selected features, were displayed for both feature selection approaches.

The code uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network models. Additionally, scatter plots were generated to visually compare predicted vs actual values for both feature selection methods, providing a comprehensive exploration of feature selection and neural network modeling for traffic count prediction.

*Sorry for the late upload but I had some problem with my personal computer and could not access the code i already worked on*

# Week 2:

Planned to do:
- Split the training set handling code into a separate file to enhance code organization and maintainability
- Explore different feature selection techniques
- Consider recursive feature elimination or other advanced feature selection methods
- Upload the large CSV file to the repository, ensuring that it's accessible for collaborative work
